This application just explains the use of Extern storage class
We can use this concept of extern storage class when we have to divide our code in two or more 
files.
important points:
1. Both files should be in same folder 
2. The sequence of  name of file  doesn't  matter  
	while compiling the apllication
3. The variable or fuction which we want to access from second file (in our case it is Extern.c) 
	must be global varibale or function
